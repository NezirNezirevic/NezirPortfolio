        <p>About Me</p>
        <p>Software Engineer</p>
        <p>Hello, My name is Nezir Nezirevic. I am a Software Engineer and can provide
            you with many of my services such as python GUI development in form of tkinter,
            PySide, and PyQt. I also provide web development in the form of HTML and CSS. 
            I am very new to JavaScript but I'm a quick learner. In the recent years I've 
            developed a strong passion for coding so therefore I love to solve stuff and to
            get stuck in code for many hours just to solve it later.</p>
        <p>If you have any interest in what I've said above contact me and I'll make sure to
            satisfy your code demands as soon as possible. I work free of charge for friends 
        and family but if you want to hire me I will make sure you sent me a repository.</p>
        <button>Hire Me</button>
        <button>Download CV</button>

        <p>Services required</p>
        <p>If you want to make any kind of Software that is related to contact me. I make 
        sure to deliver my service on time as always, if my submitted work doesn't look 
        appealing I will make sure to fix it to your decires, this will however take longer
        since I don't recieve a repository.</p>

        learning but as i've already said earlier I learn quick and at the time you are reading

        other software development based platform.</p>
